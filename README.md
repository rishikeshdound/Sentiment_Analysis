# Sentiment Analysis

A toolkit on building a movie review sentiment classification LSTM model in Keras Deep Learning and the deploying model h5 file and pickle file on local machine. 
Model is trained on IMDb Movie reviews dataset taken from Kaggle.


As part of model training,  training is done on three separate Models, namely: Simple Neural Net, CNN with  and LSTM; as a conclusion with reasoning as to why LSTMs are well suited to handle (sequential) text data.
Lstm gives best Accuracy among three over train and test Data.
